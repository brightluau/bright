# Contribution Guide

So, you wanna contribute to Bright? My oh my! You are very welcome to, just read the guide below to make sure what you're
doing is a-okay.

## Bug Reporting

Before bug reporting, please check the following:

- Is this a security issue? **STOP!** Do not open a public issue! Please report the vulnerability via GitHub's advisory
  system. You are prompted with this option when you create a new issue.

- Is this a duplicate? Please add your information (if applicable) to that issue instead of making a new one.

- Is your problem easy to reproduce? Please provide a minimal reproduction with your issue. If a reproduction is not
  possible, please detail in the clearest way you can on how to reproduce the issue, otherwise it may be closed with
  "cannot reproduce".

## Code/Documentation Contributions

### AI Generation Policy

Bright will not accept pull requests that are written completely with AI. These sorts of contributions signify that effort
was not put in to the pull request, and do not inspire any confidence that what is being contributed is functional. Please
put in human work to your contributions, rather than relying on an AI tool to do the work for you.

For tools such as Copilot, make sure that the generated code works and has been modified to fit with the project's
codestyle. Do not blindly trust generated code to be functional.

### Documentation

Bright's documentation is written to be a mix of serious and whimsy. Bright itself is not taken overly serious, as that
would make it a boring tool, and my personal opinion is that a little sprinkle of humor and general unseriousness in
documentation makes it more engaging for a developer to read through, but too much leads to it becoming annoying and
repetitive.

The current documentation has a few humorous descriptions and bits that don't take itself serious, but when it comes to
the main information, it should be considered as a more serious subject, and humor should be reduced or eliminated. The
[Transformer Basics](https://brightluau.dev/developer-guide/tutorials/transformer-basics/) guide is not really a guideline
per se, but is a good reference for what we're going for. Unserious parts are mixed in where appropriate, but the key
information is kept serious so that developers aren't deciphering jokes and whatnot to work out what to do. Essentially,
add whimsy in areas that can be ignored easier, and reduce it during key information.

Page descriptions are probably a massive exception to this rule, as they are almost exclusively written with humor in
mind. These descriptions only show in social cards, rather than on the page themselves, so it's okay to make them silly
since it won't affect the content of the page.

Most importantly though, documentation should be informal. Bright is not a company of any kind; it is a community ran thing.
Formal English tends to give an impression that something is very uptight, and that is not the vibe that we should be
going for.

The only exception to all of the above is the API documentation. It should be written in a relatively deadpan way as it's
meant to describe code, rather than be a general piece of writing.
