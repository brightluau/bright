!!! dragons "Here be dragons, thou art forewarned."

	The transformonomicon contains some loopy-land writing and confusing documentation at the moment. It will be improved
	over time, but for now this is what you get. Pull requests are very welcome.

	If you have not yet read about [Poke](../poke/index.md), please do so first. This part of the documentation assumes
	that you have, and will probably be even more confusing without it.
