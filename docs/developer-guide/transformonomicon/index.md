    The transformonomicon contains some loopy-land writing and confusing documentation at the moment. It will be improved
    over time, but for now this is what you get. Pull requests are very welcome.

    If you have not yet read about [Poke](../poke/index.md), please do so first. This part of the documentation assumes
    that you have, and will probably be even more confusing without it.

Since this book is still being written, there's not really much to talk about on its cover page Instead, you should check
out the first tutorial, [Transformer Basics](./tutorials/transformer-basics.md)!
