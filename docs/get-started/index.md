# Get Started

<!-- b:construction -->

Bright seems like your cup of tea? Try it out the instructions below!

## Installation

There are multiple ways of installing Bright, as detailed below.

### Rokit (Recommended)

If you are already using Rokit in your project, simply run `rokit add brightluau/bright`. It's that easy!

## Now what?

Now that you're set up, check out how to [initialize your project](../user-guide/initializing-a-project.md) to start
transforming your codebase into a better tomorrow. Or perhaps it's irredeemable, I don't know.
